# Subnational Birth Squeezes

This folder contains the code to fully reproduce the result of the paper **Subnational Birth Squeezes. A cross-country comparison**. All code on which this analysis is based was written in the [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language.

## Software and hardware

The analysis were executed in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23 ucrt). The computing unit was platform x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit). The program was running under Windows Server x64 (build 17763)

### Packages

This work would not have been possible with the scientific and programming contributions of people who developed packages and made them available free of use on [**R-Cran**](https://cran.r-project.org/). I list the packages used in this project to acknowledge the contribution of the authors and to ensure that people can download the required packages in order to fully reproduce the results. Furthermore, the interested reader can follow the link on the package name to read the vignettes.

## Reproduction Procedures

## Data structure

The data consists of multiple dimensions, e.g. time, region, country, age. Therefore, having a clear outline of the final data structure helps to keep the different data sets. similar.
